---------------------------------------------------------------
📝 Project Overview

This project is a Queueing Theory Simulator for M/M/1 and M/M/1/K models.
It is designed for students, engineers, and researchers to calculate and visualize queue performance metrics interactively.

The system calculates key metrics and visualizes the queue dynamics over time.
